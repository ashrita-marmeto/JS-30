    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const copy = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(copy)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
   
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const copy2 = players.slice(2)
    console.log(copy2)
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log(copy3)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players]
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    copy4.push('Remi')
    console.log(copy4)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
const copy5 = person;
console.log(copy5)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
  
const copy6 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Dave', age: '55'})
console.log(copy6)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const copy7 = {...person}
console.log(copy7)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
